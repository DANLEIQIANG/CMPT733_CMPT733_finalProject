The meaning of lables:

classification_labels
classification_labels is generated by the BERT model for sentiment classification (0 for negativeï¼Œ 1 for positive, 2 for neutral).

cluster_labels
cluster_labels is generated by sklearn cluster. 
This is generated by clustering on each file. Each document is clustered into 60 categories, the numbers represent the categories.

sentiment_cluster
csentiment_cluster is also generated by sklearn cluster. 
But unlike cluster_labels, this is first classified according to classification_labels, and then clustered on the classification results. 
For example, first filter out the data with classification_labels==0, then perform clustering on these data, and also generate 60 categories.
Filtering must be done before using sentiment_cluster. The same sentence_cluster label has different meanings when classification_labels are different
